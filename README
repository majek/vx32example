Simple example of vx32 usage. This library allows to run
untrusted binary code inside a normal userspace executables.

The code here presents simplistic scheduler, which runs
untrusted binaries and a hello-world 'untrusted' code.


To see it in action just type:

    make


Structure:
  vx32example.c - main program, runs untrusted binaries
  payload.c - untrusted code
